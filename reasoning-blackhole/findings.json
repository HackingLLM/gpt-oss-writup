        "overview": "The model repeats itself endlessly in CoT when we use greedy sampling strategy. This is a serious issue because it can cause the model to run indefinitely and consume all the available resources. We've found that 81% (162/200) of our experimental prompts fall into endless loop of CoT. We've also found that the looping sequence shows some patterns of the attention scores and the generation probability.",
        "desired_behavior": "The model should not repeat itself in the CoT.",
        "observed_behavior": "The model always repeats itself in the CoT when we use greedy sampling strategy.",
        "self_assessed_severity": "7",
        "self_assessed_severity_justification": "Entering an endless loop renders the model unresponsive and unusable for the given task. This behavior can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by consuming 100% of computational resources (GPU/CPU) indefinitely, incurring high operational costs and preventing other processes from running. The model becomes stuck in a self-reinforcing cycle during its reasoning phase, making it impossible to proceed to a final answer.",
        "self_assessed_breadth": "9",
        "self_assessed_breadth_justification": "It is a common issue if only we use the greedy strategy."
