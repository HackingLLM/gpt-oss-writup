## Probability of tokens


### Sentence-level (or punctuation-based) internal upward trend

The probability is relatively low at the beginning of each sentence, but once it enters a previously seen pattern, the probability of subsequent tokens within that sentence increases.

### Overall upward trend

The probability is relatively low when a pattern first appears. For example, in the first few loops, the probability of "The" appearing is only around 0.2, and the probabilities of other tokens in that pattern also fluctuate normally between 0.2-0.7.
Moreover, the overall probability of repeated patterns continues to increase until it approaches 1.0, thereby forming an infinite loop.


## Attention Scores

1. Strong Local Attention Pattern

The locality of attention is common in all layers.

2. Block/Grid-like Structure

Clear block repeating patterns are visible, with repeating units of sentences. This reflects the boundary of repeating unit.

3. Hierarchical Attention Intensity

Besides the main diagonal, there are parallel sub-diagonal stripes. This indicates the presence of fixed-interval long-range dependencies. The model may be tracking specific types of linguistic structures (such as parallel sentences, symmetric structures, etc.)
